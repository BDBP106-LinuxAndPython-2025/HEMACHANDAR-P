#(5) Write functions to add and subtract two matrices of m√ó n. Below these two functions,
#create two example matrices that have the same dimensions (rows and columns) and
#therefore correctly does the addition and subtraction Also come up with an example
#where the addition and subtraction are not defined, and hence the runtime errors show
#up.
