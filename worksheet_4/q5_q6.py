# 5. The 3 logical steps in accessing a file:
# Open the file.
# Read from or write to the file.
# Close the file.

# 6. Access modes to operate on files:
# 'r' : Read only (file must exist)
# 'w' : Write only (creates file or truncates existing)
# 'a' : Append (write, but add to end)
# 'r+': Read and write (file must exist)
# 'b' : Binary mode (used along with other modes, e.g., 'rb', 'wb')
